# Coding-1-Final
This website is styled in such a way as if it were formatted to market a product of some sort.
In index.html I have a few pictures in the carousel that differ from the ones that originated on the page, a navbar that allows easy navigation between different pages, and a footer which contains the live link to my repository on github.
On the contact page I have a hero image that shows a person holding a cellphone and text that describes the purpose of the page. The Navbar and footer are also present here.
On the about page I have another hero image which describes the page's purpose as well as a paragraph that tells the reader a bit about myself. The Navbar and footer are also present here.
This website functions as my final exam for Coding I.
